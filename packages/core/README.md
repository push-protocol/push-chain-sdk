# Push Chain Core

## Overview

Push Chain is a true universal L1 that is 100% EVM compatible. It allows developers to deploy once and make their apps instantly compatible with users from all other L1s (Ethereum, Solana, etc) with zero on-chain code change.

`@pushchain/core` provides core functionality to interact with the Push Chain. It enables developers to easily integrate universal messaging, transactions, and utilities into their applications.
